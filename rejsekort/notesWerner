if something is not covered by a scenario then it should not appear in the code.

Hashmaps instead of databases

Separate the  core objects

our way of asking questions is generally okay 
1. we can ask which classes implement that functionality
2. instead of using how did you find the answer, we should use explain in detail how did you find your answer
3. the quesitons are again business side, they should be formulated as presents a message "...." what internal code represents that.
4. suggestion we can have a question like. Assume you had to do this "....."  what would you change and in which classes?
